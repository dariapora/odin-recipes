# Odin Recipes

This simple website is my submission for the first assignment of the Foundations Course provided by The Odin Project. Written in basic HTML, it showcases 3 recipes originally posted on [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/). 
 ## Adjustments

 **Feb 24 2025** Having completed the Intro to CSS section of The Odin Project Foundations Course, my assignment was to add CSS styling to this website. I played around with divs and classes and made the recipe book a little bit more pleasant to look at.
