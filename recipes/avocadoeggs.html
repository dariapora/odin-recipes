    <p>This avocado egg recipe has a nice contrast between the soft and fresh avocado and the creaminess of a poached egg â€” it is brilliant. Good thing is, it's also healthy and satisfying.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 small eggs</li>
        <li>1 avocado, halved and pitted</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried parsley, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 slices cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, being careful to keep the yolks intact.</li>
        <li>Arrange avocado halves in a baking dish, resting them along the edge so avocado won't tip over. Gently spoon 1 egg yolk into the avocado hole. Continue spooning egg white into the hole until full. Repeat with remaining egg yolk, egg white, and avocado.</li>
        <li>Season each filled avocado with chives, parsley, sea salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Gently place baking dish in the preheated oven and bake until eggs are cooked, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle bacon over avocado.</li>
    </ol>
